# Class, Object and Methods using Conditional statements and Loops
## Problem Statement 1: 

#### Solve following sub problems,

1.1 Write a program to list all, even numbers less than or equal to the number n. Take the value of n as input from the user.
1.2 Define a class Rectangle with its length and breadth. Follow the below steps,
	a. Provide appropriate constructor(s), which gives facility of constructing Rectangle object with default values of length and breadth as 0 or passing value of length and breadth externally to constructor.
	b. Provide appropriate accessor & mutator methods to Rectangle class.
	c. Provide methods to calculate area & to display all information of Rectangle.
	d. Design different classTestRectangle class in a separate source file, which will contain main method. From this main method, create 5 Rectangle objects by taking all necessary information from the user and calculate respective area of rectangle objects and display it.
1.3 Create a class Bookwhich describes its book_titleand book_price. Follow the below steps,
    a.Use getter and setter methods to get & set the Books description.
    b.Implement createBooks and showBooks methods to create n objects of Book in an array.
    c.Display the books along with its description as follows,Book TitlePriceJava ProgrammingRs 350.50Let Us CRs.200.00
    d.Note: createBooks & showBooksshould not be member functions of Bookclass.
1.4Modify the program, which is created in sub problem 1.2 as follows,
    a.The class has attributes length and width, each of which defaults to 1.
    b.It should have member functions that calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle.
    c.It should have set and get functions for both length and width.
    d.The set functions should  verify that length and width are each floating-point number larger than 0.0 and less than 20.0.
